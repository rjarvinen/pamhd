This is the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) part of PAMHD, that
solves the ideal MHD equations on a cartesian grid in one
to three dimensions. Parallel computation is implemented
using message passing interface (MPI).

See http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/modelinfo.php?model=PAMHD
for running PAMHD simulations via the web and
visualizing the results.

PAMHD requires the following libraries to be installed:
Boost, cxx-prettyprint, DCCRG, Eigen, Generic simulation
cell, muparserX, Zoltan and an implementation of MPI. See
https://github.com/nasailja/pamhd/wiki/Install for
installation instructions of prerequisites. Note that
certain versions of GCC and prerequisites are known not
to work. Library/program versions known to work:

boost: 1.63.0, 1.57.0
eigen: 3.3.3, 3.3.2, 3.3.1, 3.3
gcc: 7.0 git from 2017-03-08, 5.4.0, 4.8.5
mpich: 3.1.2, 3.0.4, 2.1.5
open-mpi: 2.0.2, 2.0.1, 1.8.8, 1.8.1, 1.8, 1.6.5
zoltan: 3.83

Library/program versions known not to work:

boost: 1.53.0 (different filesystem API)
eigen: 3.2.10 (eigen.tuxfamily.org/bz/show_bug.cgi?id=360)
gcc: 6.3.0 (gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=78693), 4.7.4
open-mpi: 1.7.5

To compile PAMHD itself, run GNU make in this directory.
If prerequisites have been installed in your home
directory or into system directories, running make should
produce all test programs of which the tests/mhd/test.exe
program is the MHD part of PAMHD. If prerequisites have
been installed into custom locations you should create a
new makefile in the makefiles directory and give its
relative path in environment variable ENVIRONMENT_MAKEFILE
when running make, e.g.
make ENVIRONMENT_MAKEFILE=makefiles/fedora20

To test PAMHD installation run make test from this directory,
which will run all test programs under tests directory. If
something does not work please check whether it is a known
issue at https://github.com/iljah/pamhd/issues and if not
create a new issue. An additional set of tests is provided for
the MHD test program that are executed by changing to
tests/mhd directory and running the run_tests.sh script.
