This directory has a serial 1d reference implementation of a
MHD program and the main PAMHD MHD test program. For compilation
instruction and running basic tests see the top level README file.
Additional tests for can be run by executing the run_tests.sh in
this directory.

A large number of configuration files are available under the
config_files directory. These can be run by executing the
test.exe program from this directory and giving it one configuration
file as a command line argument, e.g.
mpiexec -n 6 ./test.exe config_files/magnetohydrodynamic/magnetosphere/2d/z1/config.json

The results can be visualized in several ways. 1d and 2d results
can be visualized with gnuplot by executing the mhd2gnuplot.exe
program with simulation output files as arguments. Simulation
results can also be converted to vtk format with mhd2vtk.exe and
visualized e.g. with https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/ . mhd2numpy.py
can be used to read simulation results into memory and plotted e.g.
with matplotlib.

A large number of PAMHD results is are also available at
https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ungrouped/LP/LP_database.php where their
respective configurations can be viewed and results plotted
through a web interface. See the following website to get started:
https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/modelinfo.php?model=PAMHD

the mhd_extract.py program can be used to extract a subvolume from
an existing result in order to make it easier to transfer or to plot
with mhd2gnuplot.exe, for example.
