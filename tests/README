This directory contains test programs for prerequisites
of PAMHD as well as for PAMHD itself. See README file
in parent directory on how to compile and run all the tests.
Tests for a particular problem can be run from within that
directory by changing into it and running GNU make, e.g.
cd mhd && make test
